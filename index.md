This is home to Wishardry's wild thoughts, embodied in the form of writing. 

The current blog state (since I'm rushing) is only Claude-assisted generated content. Yes, I'm sorry. I feel bad about it too - I'd love to write but putting these ideas out first is something that I really want to do. To all the writers out there: I'm sorry I betrayed y'all.
I will rewrite them with love and care in the future. I promise.

For now, you can see the basis of what I call the "Cipher" framework - the name comes from Gemini's help in generating a useful application of these concepts. It's three articles of ideas and my current approach to red-teaming, plus some novel insights from my own appoaches. 

Happy reading!

Update - Aug 14th: Beginnings is up, the first handwritten post. The rewrites are underway, and watch out for website changes over the next few days. Exciting stuff!
