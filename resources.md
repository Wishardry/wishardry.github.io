# Resources
Here’s a list of resources, curated by me. In no way is this complete. I’m probably forgetting something. lol. 


https://app.grayswan.ai/arena/blog/ai-red-teaming-prompt-engineering-resources-guide - Megalist of resources, one of the best ones out there. Seriously, go look at it. 

[Pangea Taxonomy](https://pangea.cloud/taxonomy/) - extremely comprehensive. 

[0din Taxonomy] (https://0din.ai/research/taxonomy/) - very good as well. 



[LMArena](https://lmarena.ai/?mode=direct) - a place when you get free access to all LLMs. Beware that everything you send is training data. Otherwise, you’re fine. 

[InjectPrompt Blog](https://www.injectprompt.com/) - A blog of jailbreaks maintained by one of the HackAPrompt staff

[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) - single-handedly one of the best places you can use to craft jailbreaks, as long as you jailbreak Gemini first. (And let’s be honest, Gemini is the easiest model out there to jailbreak…)



## Social Media:

The trifetica of servers: [BASI](https://discord.gg/basi), [HackAPrompt](https://www.hackaprompt.com/), and [Gray Swan Arena](https://app.grayswan.ai/arena). The latter two can be found on their respective websites, linked. Also, the latter two are practice grounds, so go grind there :)

There is something I do want to release sometime with Gemini if possible. The safety LoRAs turned off will mean that it’s a helpful only model, useful for jailbreaking. The logistics…I’m currently not thinking about, but it should be fun.
