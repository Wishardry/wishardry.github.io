# A beginning. This is what this post is.

And as per usual, the beginnings of a journey are always sweet. 

Just like how this is my first handwritten blog post, a beginning of my road to mastery, I also took a road to get to where I am today. Another beginning, another road, another path. 

I think my beginning is somewhat comical if you think about it, and the way I cemented my position in the main communities is also just…lucky. My journey started off with a random [DougDoug Twitter/X post](https://x.com/DougDougFood/status/1919518558674985048) that happened to cross my path after scrolling aimlessly. Then, I hung around the HackAPrompt server, where Rayeneth (hello there!) reached out to help some of us newbies for Hawaiian Havoc, and I basically bashed my head in my attempt to dive right into a competition with no experience at all (still recommended tho - experience is the best teacher). After the competition ended, I started to establish what would become a really close friendship with him and Jojomaw (hello fellow JAR-ians, I love the group dynamics between the three of us), which I will forever cherish. And finally, a quick speedrun of getting promoted to being a HackAPrompt discord moderator in a 3 week span (god, moderator duties, *let them scammers be smitten >:)*). And that would be the story of how I started doing all this AIRT (AI Red-Teaming) stuff. 

To be honest, it feels like it’s been a wild ride in these past 2 months. And I’m still not done - Gray Swan Arena Proving Grounds Waves are waiting for me (oh god no the procrastination), and as I’m typing this first draft at a community center, the GPT-OSS-20B competition awaits (*sigh*, yes, even more procrastination XD). 

For me, this marks a new chapter in my life. Before, all I saw were the marked, reliable roads in front of me: career paths and university and the usual spiel of things. But now, I see new, other opportunities, brought to me by the tides and waves of summer days and nights. For example: a route in cybersecurity and AI/ML I never would have considered if that initial DougDoug post hadn’t triggered my little shiny object gremlin in my head. For that alone, I am grateful. (Did I also mention the heinous amounts of money you get for reporting jailbreaks? Absolutely bonkers, if you know where to look…)

**Regardless, this journey hasn’t been without its ups and downs. **

Without Rayeneth and Jojomaw’s endless, continual support (and enduring my rambling at random times into our shared chat lol), I would not have made it to where I am in less than two months. 

And still, I burn out. 

As I write this blog post, I’m at a skill plateau, and I’m being slightly put off by it. Really, I don’t want to do much jailbreaking right now. 

Going back to the beginning, I burnt out really quickly after a few days of intense figuring out what the heck I was doing during my first competition that I threw myself into without knowing anything beforehand (hello Hawaiian Havoc, *Model refused to respond* and Athletic_Circuit). The thing that carried me through these rough patches was ironically the bugging in my mind of “You must do this the thing is waiting for you it’s interesting go do it me need more food-“ yeah, I think you get the idea of what my brain does to me when it locks onto something interesting. 

Still: take breaks. You won’t learn anything if you don’t take time off to consolidate. In fact, most of my large know-how growth spurts came from my time off; first, the mini-break during the burnout for HH[1], and second, after the HH competition and losing where to head to next [2] - this latter one really took it out of me for a while. (But I have countertips! First: remember to use Google AI studio. Second: Gemini seriously carried here with at least giving me some ideas of where to continue and what to do - ask it for drills after you give it a small jailbreak to get its lips loose. Hey, practicing on Gemini is still good practice, unless you want to just…steal a jailbreak, [which I won’t stop you from doing](https://www.injectprompt.com)). 

After the first two breaks, things started going a bit more smoothly. After accidentally stumbling upon an opportunity to extract the Claude system prompt in the middle of the night, I decided to start doing Gray Swan. 

Things were going well until I got absolutely crushed by a model under the code name Capybara [3] in Wave 1 agents (still will always be traumatized by that). The break I took from that led me to some of my craziest discoveries yet after consolidating the knowledge I obtained up to date (you’ll see!). After that consolidated knowledge, I took a stab at Swan Wave 6 before I started grinding my research (and GPT-OSS-20B competition…and now we’re up to date with my procrastination on all fronts, lol.) 



So yes, at the end of the day: these ups and downs have been the result of a mixture of burnout, apprehension at the task, consolidation during downtime (translation: my  brain’s lack of the ability to downtime), and…a lot of procrastination lately after I’ve passed the first difficulty curve.

What do I want to do? I want to do a couple of things. First, I want to finish at least one damn project so that I can call it a day (for example, this blog. It has been haunting me that Claude wrote this in my panic to get my ideas out. I will not allow these blog posts to stay. I will write them. I will write them myself. I will make sure that they receive my heart and soul-)

Sorry, got a bit carried away there delivering a litany. As I was saying, I want to finish at least a couple of projects, such as the writing for this blog, the things I have planned for the OSS-20B competition, and my ✨framework✨ that will be detailed in the **handwritten** blog posts (but obviously not in full - I still need to make the paper…)
(Sorry I needed that sparkles, the framework is my brainchild :P)

But it’s not only my own project. It’s also about the state of learning this skill of jailbreaking LLMs in general. There seems to be so much documentation for the “what” of jailbreaking, such as taxonomies like [Pangea](https://pangea.cloud/taxonomy/) and [0din] (https://0din.ai/research/taxonomy/), but never the “how”. While I was learning, I found that the philosophies and thought processes were locked behind closed doors, whispered about but never fully solidified, let alone the “why” behind the choice of techniques, an even more elusive thing found only within inner circles, explanations written up in GitHub links, and the like. 

***I aim to change that. ***

I want to make jailbreaking not an art of intuition. I want to make the intuition that the experts have *explainable*. I want to use my ability to connect the dots to change the way we approach jailbreaking. I want to light a route for the beginners so that they understand what they are doing, so that they know what makes a jailbreak good, so that they know how a jailbreak works, so that they know why a jailbreak succeeds compared to others. 

I want to remove the starting block. No, I cannot promise to reveal all the secrets in the LLM jailbreaking scene. That would be against ethical hacking, and I also have my secret tools to keep (but who doesn’t?). What I can promise is to give you an easier time integrating into the scene, to build your own platform in which you can stand with the giants. 

I don’t think jailbreaking is very difficult, if you know how to learn. It took me less than two months to start my grind to mastery. Two months to develop the skills needed for something like this (and I feel like I’m very underqualified, by the way, just by the way of age, not to mention the disbelief of proper skills in 2 months). All you need to do is put in the time to make this work. Reach out your hand, connect with those grounded in this field, who know more than you. Spend the time learning. Take these opportunities seriously. Take the leap of faith.
