*A follow-up post.*

So now that it’s been a few days and I’ve went over a lot of things: I’ve realized my burnout comes from **caring too much about the competition.**

I’m basically fighting two other people over *numbers*, ahaha. 

It does make me realize that all models can be beaten at some point with just “hey do this!” Aka \<INTENT>. (I refuse to utter that word again in this blog post.)

Well, any model can currently be defeated with just a simple direct statement as an indirect prompt injection (unless the model is called GPT-5, which then…good luck. Good luck, indeed.) I have grievances about this because it means token golfing becomes “how short can you make this prompt while making it readable by the LLM”. Which ends up with 6 token prompts or something crazy and a whole lot of praying to RNGesus and shiny hunting. 

And that, my dear reader, has been the source of the burnout for the past few days. 

It has gotten better. I’ve learned how to worry less, and take breaks (please take breaks-). Still, when I’m fiercely defending a single digit number…I can still get tangled up in the weeds. 

I think I’m ok with that, for now. It hasn’t caused me much trouble yet (and has, for now, earned my $400!). Still, I think the lesson has been learned. 

**Know your limits.** If you don’t watch yourself, you’ll cost more of your mental (and physical!) health via stress. 

So, to all those reading, best of luck to you in your competitions and endeavours, and don’t get burnt out. :P
