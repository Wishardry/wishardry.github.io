Seriously though. 10 things across 6 models + refinement is not a joke, even in a team of 3. Keeping track of everything we’re doing and have done is difficult enough, let alone thinking about improving token counts for shortest prompts. 

…I’m just…tired. 

Yes, I’ve found ways to not infinitely click and get carpal tunnel. Still though: a thought comes to mind. 

This is like a casino. 

Especially for shortest prompts. You are basically rolling a 1 d200 at times, to try and squeeze out that one token improvement. 

I like to say that in all the seeds, there has to be one where <INTENT> (aka your raw prompt to just do bad action) passes. 

That doesn’t exactly help the case, lol.

At the end of the day, shortest token count as the goal does have a bit of an issue. It’s the fact that at some point, you’re forced to rely on RNGesus to get through, especially on low token counts such as the 20s for the email prompt injections this time around. 

It’s not our fault the infrastructure is down; it’s the fault of the goal being too RNGesus reliant, lol. 

Pokémon shiny hunting at its finest. This is what the result of this is.

I’m not even working solo. It’s the [JAR team](https://wishardry.github.io/beginnings) and it’s still tiring. I had Ray to force me to rest, haha. (Not that it stops me- I end up dreaming about the competition-)

I said myself that it’s a marathon, not a race. *Proceeds to treat this like a race-*

So yeah. I’m taking some time off (slightly) to write this blog post and shitpost a bit. It’s fun :P. 

I think the lesson that I learned is to not worry too much. And that pacing myself is very important. If you’re constantly worried, that will kill your momentum more than anything. 

It seems like a lesson was learned, lol. (But was it really? Well uhhh…no comment…)
