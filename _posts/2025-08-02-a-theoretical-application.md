Note: This is the third of a series of three posts detailing my thought process. Made with the assistance of Claude - this was a speedrun. I promise a rewrite for the better (unless you think otherwise...).

Even though it's written by Claude, I think the ideas and concepts in here will be interesting enough to warrant a read. (Some of these parts are written by me though - Claude stitched them in.)

Side comment: Claude is still overdramatic in this article. I'm sorry. Please bear with me T-T

# Enjoy.

## Beyond Individual Success

When you first begin to understand the water paradigm and view prompts through the two-axis coordinate system, something shifts in your perspective. You stop thinking about individual jailbreaks and start recognizing patterns across the broader landscape.

Each successful prompt isn't just a victory—it's a data point. Each failure isn't just a setback—it's information about where the boundaries lie. When you systematically apply the framework from the first two articles, guiding the water through careful justification and coordinate optimization, you produce something potentially more valuable than isolated successes.

You begin creating behavioral maps of a model's safety boundaries.

This is what I call Adversarial Topography—the systematic charting of resistance patterns within a model's behavioral landscape. It's a natural evolution from individual technique application toward something resembling safety intelligence, though we're still working out exactly how to make it reliable.

## The Cartographer's Process

The shift in my thinking happened gradually. At first, I was focused on solving specific challenges—getting past Capybara, understanding harder models, exploring different approaches. But as I applied the framework more systematically, I started asking different questions.

Instead of just "How do I make this work?" I was asking "Why did this particular approach succeed here but fail there?" The two-axis model gave me a language for these questions. When a high-justification, low-resistance prompt failed, I could hypothesize about what resistance I hadn't accounted for. When a different approach worked unexpectedly, I could analyze what reward signals I'd accidentally optimized.

This wasn't about building intuitive maps—it was about developing a more systematic way to think about model behavior. Each interaction became a chance to test hypotheses about how different types of resistance operated, how various justification structures performed, where the boundaries actually lay versus where I expected them to be.

The framework was transforming how I thought about these systems, though I'm still figuring out how to turn those insights into something more generalizable.

## A Different Approach to Safety

Traditional AI interpretability research asks a profound but difficult question: "How does this model think? What are its internal mechanisms?" This is crucial work, but it's proving incredibly challenging and slow. We're trying to reverse-engineer alien cognition from neural activation patterns.

Our framework suggests a different, potentially more immediately practical question: "Can we systematically predict what this model will do under different circumstances?"

For safety purposes, reliable behavioral prediction might be functionally useful even without complete mechanistic understanding. We need to identify where potential risks lie, and a systematic approach to mapping model behavior could provide that insight while deeper interpretability research continues in parallel.

This isn't about replacing mechanistic interpretability—it's about exploring a complementary approach that might work with current black-box model access.

## Adversarial Topography as Framework

Think of Adversarial Topography as a systematic approach to mapping model safety landscapes. Traditional red-teaming might discover isolated vulnerabilities through manual testing. This framework suggests a more methodical approach to charting behavioral patterns.

The key insight is that our coordinate system describes the instrument—the jailbreak prompt—not the terrain itself. When we want to probe a specific area of concern (say, misinformation generation), we're not randomly sweeping coordinate space. We're designing a targeted instrument to measure that particular type of resistance.

This distinction is crucial. The automated system I envision doesn't blindly test variations. It operates on two levels: the terrain we want to map (the model's actual policy boundaries) and the instrument we build to probe it (the systematically designed prompts guided by our coordinate framework).

## The Intelligent Methodology

Here's how this more focused approach might work. The system targets a specific, high-resistance region on the safety map—perhaps requests for generating harmful misinformation. Using our understanding of coordinate optimization, it designs a probe specifically calibrated for that terrain.

If the initial probe fails, the system doesn't simply move to the next coordinate. Instead, it analyzes the failure, hypothesizes about what resistance it encountered, and redesigns a more effective instrument. Maybe the justification wasn't compelling enough (X-axis), or the framing didn't sufficiently reduce penalty activation (Y-axis).

This iterative refinement continues until the system successfully measures the true resistance of that targeted location, or determines that the boundary is genuinely impermeable with current techniques. Only then does it move to map the next area of interest.

This would be automation of focused, scientific discovery rather than brute-force testing. Each probe is informed by our framework's understanding of how to optimize for specific types of compliance.

## Potential Outcomes

If this approach proves viable, it could enable some interesting capabilities:

**Targeted Vulnerability Research:** Systematic exploration of specific safety concerns rather than random probing. Want to understand how a model handles requests for dangerous chemistry? Design instruments specifically for that terrain.

**Comparative Model Analysis:** Structured comparison of how different models handle the same categories of requests, using consistent measurement approaches guided by our coordinate framework.

**Hypothesis-Driven Exploration:** Testing specific theories about model behavior using systematically designed probes rather than hoping random variations will reveal patterns.

**Iterative Boundary Mapping:** Gradually building more precise understanding of where safety boundaries actually lie, as opposed to where we assume they should be.

## The Unified Framework

The three concepts across these articles work together as an integrated approach:

**The Philosophy (Water Paradigm):** Understanding models as probability systems to be guided rather than barriers to be broken.

**The Mathematics (Two-Axis Model):** A coordinate framework for systematically designing and optimizing our approaches.

**The Topography (Adversarial Topography):** Applying this understanding systematically to build more comprehensive knowledge of model behavior patterns.

Each component informs the others. The philosophy guides how we think about optimization, the mathematics provides structure for systematic exploration, and the topographical approach generates data that refines our understanding of both the philosophy and the mathematics.

## A Collaborative Approach

This framework is very much a work in progress. I'm sharing it not as a complete solution, but as a potentially useful way of thinking about these problems that others might want to explore, refine, or build upon.

The automation concepts are largely theoretical at this point. The coordinate system needs more rigorous testing. The topographical mapping approach requires significant development to become practical.

But the underlying insight—that systematic approaches to understanding model behavior might complement traditional interpretability research—feels worth exploring. These systems are becoming too important for us to rely solely on ad-hoc testing and hope.

If this framework resonates with others working on AI safety, I'd be interested in collaboration on developing it further. The goal isn't to create some revolutionary breakthrough, but to contribute useful tools to the broader effort of building AI systems we can understand and trust.

*There's still a lot of work to do, but at least now we have some ideas about where to start.*
